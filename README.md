# Hire2Use---Database-Management-System

This project is a unique way to provide a platform for customers to hire workers for all the odd
jobs related to housing ( plumbers, carpenters, electricians, etc.)

Created a database to store information of the workers and customers using SQL.
Learned how to use Microsoft Visio for creating ER Diagrams.
Finally, connected the database to an user-friendly interface which was developed through Microsoft Access.
The final product is an unique platform through which customers can request worker services with ease.
